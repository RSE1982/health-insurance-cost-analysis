## Project Overview

Healthcare Insurance Cost Analysis explores a dataset from Kaggle
 to understand how personal and geographic attributes influence medical insurance charges.

The project applies data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) techniques, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualisation, to reveal trends in healthcare costs based on age, BMI, smoking habits, family size, and region.

This project was completed as part of the Code Institute Data Analytics with AI Bootcamp and meets all criteria for the Individual Formative Assignment.

## Dataset Content

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle ‚Äì Healthcare Insurance Cost Analysis
.

It contains the following variables:

|Field| Description |
|-----|-------------|
|age:|Age of primary beneficiary |
|sex: |Gender (male/female)|
|bmi: |Body mass index|
|children: |Number of dependents covered by insurance|
|smoker: |Smoking status|
|region: |Geographic region (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)|
|charges: |Individual medical costs billed by health insurance|

The dataset is clean, well-structured, and suitable for statistical and visual analysis.

## Business Requirements

- Identify factors that most strongly influence healthcare insurance costs
- Analyse demographic and behavioural attributes (e.g., smoking) that increase charges
- Compare regional differences in average charges
- Provide clear, visual summaries of insights for decision-making

## Hypothesis and how to validate?

## Project Plan

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used

## Ethical considerations

## Unfixed Bugs

## Development Roadmap
