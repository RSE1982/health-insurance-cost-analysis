## üìò Project Overview
Healthcare Insurance Cost Analysis explores a dataset from Kaggle
 to understand how personal and geographic attributes influence medical insurance charges.

The project applies data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) techniques, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualisation, to reveal trends in healthcare costs based on age, BMI, smoking habits, family size, and region.

This project was completed as part of the Code Institute Data Analytics with AI Bootcamp and meets all criteria for the Individual Formative Assignment.
